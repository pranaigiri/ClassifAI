# ClassifAI
Built using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This tool is built for classifying images with multi-model selection which consists of two pre-trained models:
 - Common Herbal Plants found in Sikkim
 - Fruits Nutrition

It can also be used to classify images with your own custom trained models.

This project was developed for my Major Project in SRM University Sikkim during the VI Semester of my BSc.IT Course.

Have fun trying!
